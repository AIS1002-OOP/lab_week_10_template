# Week 10 lab

This lab features an open-ended problem, meaning there are no pre-made tests available to test your code.
[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) is however included in the project, and you are encouraged to write your own tests.
Lookup online documentation and use the example we went through in class for reference. What can be tested in this project?

## Problem statement

You should implement a small Command Line Interface (CLI) application that is able to create a `person` based on user input.
The project is initialized with 3 menu options:
1. Print persons (print all stored persons)
2. Print individual (print a single individual)
3. Add person (create and store a new person in your application)

Feel free to add more options. E.g., removal of a person.

You will need to add all the necessary logic for the above options to make sense. 
Including the definition of a `person` and what a user should type to fulfill the applications requirements.
